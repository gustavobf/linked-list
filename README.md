# linked-list

A simple implementation of different types of linked lists in Java.

## 🧠 About

This repository contains simple and educational implementations of multiple linked list structures in Java.  
It is intended for learners who want to understand how linked lists work internally — without using Java's built-in collections.

## 🔗 Types of Linked Lists

This repository includes implementations for:

- **Singly Linked List**  
  Each node points to the next one. Good for simple traversal and basic operations.

- **Doubly Linked List**  
  Each node points to both the next and previous elements, allowing reverse traversal and more efficient deletions.

More types can be added in the future.

## ✅ Features

- Create and manipulate a doubly linked list
- Insert elements at the beginning (`prepend`)
- Insert elements at the end (`append`)
- Insert elements at any position (`insertAt`)
- Remove an element by value (`remove`)
- Remove an element by index (`removeAt`)
- Check whether a value exists in the list (`contains`)
- Get the first element (`getFirst`)
- Get the last element (`getLast`)
- Get an element by index (`get`)
- Retrieve internal node by index (`getAt`)
- Keep track of the current list size (`size`)
- Maintain head, tail, and length for efficient operations
  
More features can be added in the future.
