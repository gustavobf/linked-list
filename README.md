# linked-list

A simple implementation of different types of linked lists in Java.

## 🧠 About

This repository contains simple and educational implementations of multiple linked list structures in Java.  
It is intended for learners who want to understand how linked lists work internally — without using Java's built-in collections.

## 🔗 Types of Linked Lists

This repository includes implementations for:

- **Singly Linked List**  
  Each node points to the next one. Good for simple traversal and basic operations.

- **Doubly Linked List**  
  Each node points to both the next and previous elements, allowing reverse traversal and more efficient deletions.

More types can be added in the future.

## ✅ Features

- Create and manipulate singly and doubly linked lists  
- Insert elements at the beginning or end
  
More features can be added in the future.
